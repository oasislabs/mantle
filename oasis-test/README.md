A framework for unit testing Oasis executables and integration testing Oasis workflows.
For the most part, all you need to know about this crate is that it provides the [`create_account`](https://docs.rs/oasis-test/latest/oasis-test/fn.create_account.html) function.

This crate is due to be replaced with `memchain`.
