# oasis-macros

Procedural macros used by the [`oasis`](https://github.com/oasislabs/oasis/tree/master/oasis) library.
If you're reading these out of anything other than pure curiosity, you should feel encouraged to [file an issue](https://github.com/oasislabs/oasis/issues/new) instead.
There's nothing worse than a macro that _almost_ works.
