A framework for unit testing Mantle executables and integration testing Mantle workflows.
For the most part, all you need to know about this crate is that it provides the [`create_account`](https://docs.rs/mantle-test/latest/mantle-test/fn.create_account.html) function.

This crate is due to be replaced with `memchain`.
