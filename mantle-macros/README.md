# mantle-macros

Procedural macros used by the [`mantle`](https://github.com/oasislabs/mantle/tree/master/mantle) library.
If you're reading these out of anything other than pure curiosity, you should feel encouraged to [file an issue](https://github.com/oasislabs/mantle/issues/new) instead.
There's nothing worse than a macro that _almost_ works.
